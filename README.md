This is XSS_Dev, a link creator that will generate a link from code! v1.3 is in development.<br>
This program is compatible with UNIX based systems (might be windows compatible). The following dependencies have to be installed: 
- Python 3
- PIP
- cURL

The installation process is actually quite simple.
1) Type the following code into your terminal:
`curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gingerale20/XSS_Dev-1.2/main/install.sh`
3) Again, with `chmod 755 $HOME/install.sh`, although this may need to be ran as root, meaning that you would use your directory of your home folder instead of `$HOME`
4) Run `$HOME/install.sh`
5) The process is now complete! Enjoy using XSS_Dev! To run XSS_Dev, type `xss_dev` into your terminal.
